# What’s a Test Runner?

A test runner is a tool that automates the process of executing tests in the development of software, ensuring that code changes do not break existing functionality.

It allows developers to run tests across different environments and conditions systematically.

Test runners can be part of a larger test **framework or standalone** tools.

# Usual features

<div class="dense">

- **Test Discovery:** Automatically detecting and running all test cases within specified directories or files.
- **Test Organization:** Allowing tests to be grouped, categorized, or tagged for selective execution.
- **Result Reporting:** Providing detailed reports on test outcomes, including successes, failures, and exceptions.
- **Integration Support:** Offering compatibility with Continuous Integration (CI) systems for automated testing within development pipelines.

# Poplular examples

Popular examples include `pytest` for Python, `JUnit` for Java, `Mocha` for JavaScript, and `NUnit` for .NET.

Choosing the right test runner depends on the programming language, the complexity of the project, and specific project requirements.
